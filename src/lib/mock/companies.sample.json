    "product_description": "Scope provides AI-native inspection software specifically built for the testing, inspection and certification (TIC) sector. The platform offers automatic data extraction from technical diagrams, maintenance manuals, and paper documents to eliminate manual data entry into CMMS and EAM systems. Key capabilities include complex data extraction from structured and semi-structured sources, integration with existing systems via webhooks or APIs, autofill of inspection results using historical qualitative data to generate written schemes of examination (WSE) and work orders, and best-in-class error detection models for quality review of inspection reports. The software enables inspectors to run inspections 10 times faster with improved accuracy, reduces end-to-end industrial inspection time by 2.2x on average, and increases efficiency rates by 40%.",
    "target_customer": "Inspection companies and inspectors in the testing, inspection and certification (TIC) sector, particularly those conducting industrial inspections",
    "problem_solved": "Inspection companies are limited by the expertise and number of their inspectors, facing challenges with manual data entry, slow inspection processes, inconsistent accuracy, and difficulty scaling operations without growing headcount. The platform addresses the need for faster, more accurate inspections while reducing operational costs and enabling revenue growth without proportional headcount increases.",
    "differentiator": "Scope is positioned as the only AI-native inspection software provider in the TIC space, with a platform custom-built specifically for this sector rather than being a generic AI tool adapted for inspections. The company emphasizes its best-in-class accuracy through advanced error detection models, the ability to drive inspection decision making using historical qualitative data, and the unique capability to automatically generate written schemes of examination and work orders. Their focus on automating data extraction from technical documents and integration with existing CMMS/EAM systems provides a comprehensive solution that addresses the entire inspection workflow.",
